# Learning project through Foundation of Game Engine series

This repo is more or less a place where I follow the "Foundation of Game Engine" book series.

This isn't a whole Engine Project but more understanding the math & the things lying behind a Engine while implementing the code either given by this book or the knowledge i gain :)
